# The-First-or-last-repository
From a lazy man with severe delusion.

  Eh...I'm a Chinese. And I think it'd be better to finish the first repository in English which can make me professionally to some extent...
  Well,in addition to be cool,another destination to use github is that I want to study Python systematically. I need a place to store,modify,manage and share my idea(code) with others(or just myself). Eh...I'm a lazy man and I often give up doing one thing because of various of reasons like too difficult,too boring,feeling there's no better prospect etc. But recently, as the popularity of AI(artificial intelligence) wider and wider, I'm appealed to the wonderful incredible computer language and I... WELL I JUST WANG TO HAVE THE SAME JOB LIKE OTHERS' WORKING ON AI SO THAT I CAN EARN A LOT OF MONEY.
  So,now you can regard me as a ostrich, an idiot has no endurance but still want to live a rich life...
  BUT,anyone can change. The key reason why a person resists doing sth to make him better is just the missing of his interest. Maybe I can find my interest this time, who knows?
  I'll persist to record the process of learning Python and some procedures on the github for somedays,maybe some months? 
  Bless me!
